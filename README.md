# AutoYaST Integration Tests

Test framework for running AutoYaST integration tests by using Veewee and
Vagrant.

## Features

  * Building Vagrant images by using AutoYaST profiles.
  * Checking these images with RSpec tests.
  * Generating own installation ISO images with local built RPMs or the newest
    one from OBS.
  * QEMU/KVM (through libvirt) and VirtualBox are supported.

## Overview

## Supported Scenarios

These integration tests need to start virtual machines for their operation. If
you want to use QEMU/KVM, support for hardware virtualization is vitally
important. Check it on your host system:

    $ grep --only-matching '\(svm\|vmx\)' /proc/cpuinfo

Alternatively, you can just use VirtualBox (no hardware virtualization support
is needed).

If you prefer, you can install the framework in a QEMU/KVM machine. For that
scenario to work you must enable _nested virtualization_ and also expose
virtualization extensions. 

You can check if the parameter for nested virtualization is enabled with:

    $ cat /sys/module/kvm_intel/parameters/nested #(Intel based machines)
    $ cat /sys/module/kvm_amd/parameters/nested #(AMD based machines)

To enable, just add this options to the modules and then reload them or restart your machine:

    $ sudo sh -c "echo 'options kvm-intel nested=1' >> /etc/modprobe/kvm-intel.conf"
    $ sudo sh -c "echo 'options kvm-amd nested=1' >> /etc/modprobe/kvm-amd.conf"

And if you're using libvirt, you can expose 'virtualization extensions' setting `cpu mode`
to `host-model` or `host-passthrough`. You can find more information in the [official
documentation](https://libvirt.org/formatdomain.html#elementsCPU).

## Installation

  1. Unless you run tests as 'root', configure `sudo` in order to run the `mksusecd`,
     `systemctl start libvirtd` and `zypper in` commands as root.

     This will grant access to execute every command for user <username> as root without
     asking for password (unsecure):

         echo '<username> ALL=NOPASSWD: ALL' >> /etc/sudoers

  2. Add [YaST:Head](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/YaST:/Head/openSUSE_42.1/YaST:Head.repo)
     and [devel:languages:ruby:extensions](https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/devel:languages:ruby:extensions)
     repositories. For example, if you're running openSUSE Leap 42.2:

         $ sudo zypper ar -f -r http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/YaST:/Head/openSUSE_Leap_42.2/YaST:Head.repo
         $ sudo zypper ar -f -r http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/languages:/ruby:/extensions/openSUSE_Leap_42.2/devel:languages:ruby:extensions.repo

  3. Install package ruby2.1-rubygem-aytests (or ruby2.2-rubygem-aytests) and
     clone tests repository (tests are also available in the package
     aytests-tests):

         $ sudo zypper in ruby2.1-rubygem-aytests git
         $ git clone https://github.com/yast/aytests-tests

  4. The task `setup` will do a lot of work for you. After that, you should logout
     and login again (as the user will be added to some groups):

         $ aytests setup

  5. If the host is running a firewall, you must permit connections from
     libvirt default network to host’s port 8888. For example, if you’re
     running SuSEfirewall2 and your libvirt default network is 192.168.122.0
     (you can check it on `/etc/libvirt/qemu/networks/default.xml`), you could
     add a custom rule to /etc/sysconfig/SuSEfirewall2 allowing incoming
     connections from 192.168.122.0/24 to TCP port 8888, e.g.:

         FW_SERVICES_ACCEPT_EXT="192.168.122.0/24,tcp,8888"

     After that, you must reboot your system to be sure everything works
     properly (libvirt iptables rules, ip forwarding, etc.).

## Running

This is the workflow used to run integration tests:

* Create an ISO image to test. This ISO will contain the latest YaST packages,
  although it's also possible to use any other image.
* Install the system using the generated ISO and run the tests on the resulting
  system. You can run the tests as many times as you want using the same
  installed system.

Actually, the second step can be seen as two different steps (building the
system and running the tests). But for now, we'll keep them tied.

Since December 2015 AYTests uses a special directory to perform all the
actions: downloading the ISO, building the virtual machine, etc.
`$HOME/aytests-workspace` is used by default. You can change it via the
`--work-dir` option.

    $ aytests build_iso sles12-sp1 --work-dir $HOME/another-directory

After this brief introduction, let's go deeper into each step.

### Generating an ISO

Generating a new ISO to use in tests is as easy as typing:

    $ aytests build_iso sles12-sp1

where `sles12-sp1` could be any of the values defined in
[config/definitions.yml](https://github.com/yast/autoyast-integration-test/blob/master/config/definitions.yml).
At this time SLE 12 (`sles12`) and SLE 12 SP1 (`sles12-sp1`) are supported.

These are the steps that will be performed by this task:

* If the original ISO is not found in the `iso` directory, it will be
  downloaded. Optionally you can just copy the ISO (retaining its _original_
  name) into the `iso` directory. You can find out the _original_ name in
  [config/definitions.yml](https://github.com/yast/autoyast-integration-test/blob/master/config/definitions.yml).
* Latest YaST packages will also be downloaded from build system (IBS/OBS). If you
  want to include your own packages, just drop them into `rpms/<definition>` under
  *work directory* (e.g. `$HOME/aytests-workspace/rpms/sles12-sp1`).
* Those packages will be included in a [Driver
  Update](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Linuxrc#p_dud) (DUD).
* Finally, the DUD will be added to the ISO. The new ISO will be copied to
  `$HOME/aytests-workspace/iso/obs.iso`.

If you want to use another ISO, just copy it to `iso/obs.iso` under the *work
directory* and it will be used.

### Running the tests

Once the ISO is available, the tests are ready to run. All tests are defined in the
`test` directory. For example, to run `aytests/tftp.rb` test, just type:

    $ aytests test aytests/tftp.rb

If you want to run all the tests in `test` directory, just type:

    $ aytests test aytests/*.rb

By default, tests will run using QEMU/KVM as backend. But it's possible to
select a different provider via the `--provider` option or setting the
`AYTESTS_PROVIDER` environment variable. At this time, `libvirt` and
`virtualbox` are supported:

    $ aytests test aytests/tftp.rb --provider virtualbox
    $ AYTESTS_PROVIDER="virtualbox" aytests test aytests/tftp.rb

Now, the nitty-gritty details. For every test file, these steps will be
performed:

* A new Vagrant box will be created using the ISO and the profile named after
  the test (e.g. `aytests/tftp.xml`).
  [Veewee](https://github.com/jedi4ever/veewee) will take care of this part.
* Using the generated Vagrant box, a new virtual machine will be created and
  the tests will run on that machine.
* If any test failed, the YaST2 logs will be copied to `log` directory under
  *work directory*.
* Finally, the virtual machine will be destroyed.

### Re-running the tests

Sometimes is useful to run a given test but skipping the installation process,
which is quite time consuming. To execute a test but skipping the installation:

    $ aytests test <path/to/test.rb> --skip-build

For example:

    $ bundle exec rspec aytests/tftp.rb --skip-build

### Debugging

To help with debugging, AYTests will store a screenshot and, if possible, YaST2
logs from installation/upgrade under the workspace. Assuming that the default
settings are used, they'll be saved under `$HOME/aytests-workspace/results`.

Each run will have its data saved in a directory named after the current
date/time in the form `YYYYMMDDhhmm`.

The screenshot will be refreshed every 30 seconds so, if a timeout occurs,
it will easy to find out where the process got stuck.

About logs, they're retrieved through SSH so, if installation/upgrade crashed,
there's a big risk that they're not saved.

### Headless mode

VirtualBox can run in headless mode if needed. To do that, just use the
`--headless` option or set the `AYTESTS_HEADLESS` environment variable to
`true`.

    $ aytests test astests/tftp.rb --headless
    $ AYTESTS_HEADLESS="true" aytests test

This setting is not relevant to QEMU/KVM which will run in *headless* mode
anyway.

## Cleaning-up

Two tasks for cleaning-up stuff are available. To remove cache
(`<work_dir>/cache`) and [Kiwi](https://doc.opensuse.org/projects/kiwi/doc/)
state (`<work_dir>/veewee/import_state.yaml`) use:

    $ aytests clean

If you also want to remove ISO images (downloaded and generated ones), logs and
the Vagrant box file (`kiwi/autoyast.box`), is safe to remove just the *work
directory*.

## Caveats

* The framework can be a little bit fragile. Polishing is needed.
* Usability also needs some love.

## Solving Problems

### Connection to libvirt

If you are experiencing *There was a problem opening a connection to libvirt:
libvirt is not a recognized compute provider* error, you might need to
downgrade gems 'fog' and 'fog' core to version 1.30 to 1.29

    $ gem list fog
    $ gem install fog --version 1.29
    $ gem uninstall fog --version 1.30
    $ gem install fog-core --version 1.29
    $ gem uninstall fog-core --version 1.30

### libvirt 'default' network does not start

If you're running AutoYaST integration tests in a virtual machine (as mentioned
in the _Supported Scenarios_ section) you should make sure that you're using different
IP ranges. For example, if you are using `192.168.122.0/24` in the host machine, you should
use another one (e.g. `192.168.123.0/24`) in the guest. The following commands will be
helpful:

    $ sudo virsh net-dumpxml default
    $ sudo virsh net-edit default

Finally, don't use `192.168.121.0/24` as it will be used by libvirt Vagrant plugin.

### VirtualBox and KVM conflicts

You must take into account that KVM and VirtualBox can't be running at the same
time. If for example you want to switch to VirtualBox, unload `kvm` (and
related) kernel module and load `vboxdrv` and friends.

    # rmmod kvm
    # rcvboxdrv start

### Leap 42.1

Libvirt (1.2.* on Leap 42.1) has problems while deleting volumes from the `default` pool:

    # sudo virsh vol-delete autoyast_vagrant_box_image_0.img default
    # error: Failed to delete vol autoyast_vagrant_box_image_0.img
    # error: cannot unlink file '/var/lib/libvirt/images/autoyast_vagrant_box_image_0.img': Success

libvirt-1.3.5-15.9.x86_64 solves this problem.

After installation of the RPM please run:

    # systemctl start virtlogd.socket

in order to initialize the socket communication.
